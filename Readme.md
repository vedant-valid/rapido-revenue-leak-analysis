## Business Problem
Ride-hailing platforms like Rapido face a persistent operational challenge: balancing rider demand with driver supply across different service types and time windows. High cancellation rates erode customer trust, reduce revenue, and signal inefficiencies in resource allocation. This project analyzes 50,000 ride-level transactions from Bangalore to uncover patterns in ride demand, cancellation behavior, and revenue distribution. We expect that areas with high ride demand tend to experience higher cancellation rates due to insufficient driver availability, especially during peak hours. By identifying these patterns, Rapido's operations team can optimize driver deployment and reduce lost revenue.

### Core Business Question
How do service type, time of day, and location influence ride cancellation rates and revenue — and where should Rapido focus driver allocation to minimize cancellations during peak demand?

### Decision Supported
This analysis enables Rapido's operations team to identify high-cancellation zones and peak-hour bottlenecks, allowing them to implement targeted driver incentives, surge allocation strategies, and service-specific supply planning to improve completion rates and maximize revenue.

## Data Cleaning & ETL Methodology
The cleaning process was designed to transform raw ride-level transactional data into a high-quality, analysis-ready dataset focused on **demand, cancellation, and revenue insights**.

Key steps included:
1. **Missing Value Handling (Business-Logic Driven)**: Cancelled rides naturally have no fare or payment data. Instead of dropping these rows, we set `ride_charge`, `misc_charge`, and `total_fare` to `0` and `payment_method` to `"Not Applicable"`. For completed rides, `total_fare` was recalculated as `ride_charge + misc_charge` to fix inconsistencies.
2. **Datetime Conversion**: The `date` column was converted to `datetime64`. A new `time_stamp` column was created by combining source date and time strings for unified analysis.
3. **Duplicate Removal**: Duplicate records were removed by deduplicating on `ride_id`, keeping only the first occurrence.
4. **Categorical Standardization**: All text columns (`services`, `ride_status`, `payment_method`, `source`, `destination`) were lowercased and stripped. Service names were normalized (e.g., `bike lite` → `bike_lite`, `cab economy` → `cab_economy`).
5. **Anomaly Filtering**: Dropped completed rides with physically implausible conditions: distance > 100km, distance <= 0km, or duration <= 0min.
6. **Feature Engineering**: Created new analytical columns including `total_fare`, `year`, `month`, `hour`, `day_of_week`, `peak_hour`, `completed`, `is_weekend`, `avg_speed_kmh`, `fare_per_km`, and `ride_efficiency`.

For the full implementation, see `notebooks/01_extraction.ipynb` and `notebooks/02_cleaning.ipynb`.

## Dataset
| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Source Name** | Bangalore Rapido Ride Data (Simulated) |
| **Row Count (Raw)** | 51,000 |
| **Row Count (Cleaned)** | 49,801 |
| **Column Count (Raw)** | 13 |
| **Column Count (Cleaned)** | 30 |
| **Time Period Covered** | April 10 - April 29 |
| **Format** | CSV |

### Key Columns Used
| Column Name | Description | Role in Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ride_status` | Whether the ride was completed or cancelled | **Target Variable** (KPI 1 — Cancellation Rate) |
| `total_fare` | Total revenue charged for a completed ride | **Target Variable** (KPI 2 — Revenue) |
| `services` | Type of Rapido service (auto, bike, bike_lite, cab_economy, parcel) | Segmentation / Filter |
| `hour` | Hour of the day (0-23) | Peak demand identification |
| `peak_hour` | Binary flag: 1 if ride occurred during peak hours (8–10 AM, 5–7 PM) | Demand pattern analysis |
| `source_cancel_rate` | Average cancellation rate for the specific pickup location | Geographic reliability metric |
| `demand_intensity` | Z-score/Normalized volume for source-hour combination | Demand vs. Cancellation analysis |
| `avg_speed_kmh` | Average speed of the ride in km/h | Operational efficiency |
| `fare_per_km` | Revenue generated per kilometer traveled | Unit economics metric |
| `ride_efficiency` | Ratio of distance to duration (relative to service average) | Service quality KPI |

## KPI Framework
| KPI | Definition | Formula / Computation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ride Cancellation Rate (%)** | Percentage of rides cancelled out of total rides booked | `10.4%` (5,180 / 49,801) |
| **Total Revenue (₹)** | Total fare earned from all completed rides | `₹6,837,929` |
| **Average Revenue per Ride (₹)** | Average fare earned per completed ride | `₹153.24` |

## Key Analytical Insights
*Based on the statistical analysis performed in `notebooks/04_statistical_analysis.ipynb`.*

1. **Demand-Cancellation Correlation**: Validated that areas with high ride demand (z-score > 1.0) experience significantly higher cancellation rates, confirming the driver supply bottleneck hypothesis.
2. **Peak Hour Vulnerability**: Cancellation rates spike by **15-20%** during peak morning (8-10 AM) and evening (5-7 PM) windows, primarily driven by the `cab_economy` and `auto` services.
3. **Revenue Leakage**: Simulated revenue recovery suggests that reducing cancellations in top 5 'High Demand' zones by just **10%** could reclaim approximately **₹120,000** in monthly revenue.
4. **Service Efficiency**: `bike` and `bike_lite` services maintain the highest completion rates (92%+) even during peak hours, suggesting they are the most resilient resource during high traffic.
5. **Geographic Hotspots**: Identified specific source zones (e.g., Koramangala, HSR Layout) that generate 40% of total revenue but suffer from inconsistent driver availability.
